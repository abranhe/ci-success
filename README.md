# Description

**CI-SUCCESS** was created with the objective of cheat on [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org) when testing Node.js modules. **CI-SUCCESS** is completely useless and *anti-testing* at all. It won't check or test anything and will always return `0` (at least I hope so 😬 ), and if you are a programmer, developer or something like that: you will know what `0` means.

Sometimes I don't want to create tests for my projects, and get travis running ok, I was exhausted to use `echo PASSING` so I created it.

HD images are only available on [iTerm](https://www.iterm2.com/).

> ⚠️ NOTE: I don't use it a lot, and I recommend to you not to use it. CREATE YOUR TESTS ☝🏻
